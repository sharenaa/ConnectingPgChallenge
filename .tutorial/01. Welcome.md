# Gold 🥇 Connecting Pages Challenges


Someone has submitted a bug report on about this web site. 

The *index.html* page is the home page of this website and has three internal hyperlinks, links to other pages on the same website. It is missing the internal link to charlesBridge.html


There are four HTML pages about bridges:
- *charlesBridge.html*
- *goldenBridge.html*
- *goldenGateBridge.html*
- *towerBridge.html*

Each bridge page has a internal hyperlink that goes to the *index.html* page. This is missing from the *charlesBridge.html* page.
